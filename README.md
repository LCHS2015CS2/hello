# Hello World Exercise
This exercise is intended to introduce you to the process of
cloning a repo and making commits. What I would like for you
to do is the following:

1. Clone the repo to your local disk
2. Modify the Java file to make it do what it's supposed to.
3. Make a commit in your local repo to record your work.
